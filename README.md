Note that
- Backend service provides a free chatGpt service for you, you don't have to pay for it, I will try my best to keep it running. Right now, I have built a account pool which contains 3 open ai accounts, public users are sharing these 3 open ai accounts. But note that, since you're using the public chatGpt service, the service may not be stable, may not be able to respond your question quickly, or sometimes temporary unavailable
- You can still provide and configure your own open ai key to ensure that you have the best experience.

## About the user data
- The message data is only stored locally in your local storage, which is safe with you. The backend service does not save any user data.
- Your local storage size is limited, this extension only store 1000 messages, and if you generate more than 1000 messages, the oldest messages will be removed from local storage. 1000 messages is actually a lot, which could be 2-4 weeks of chat data, that should be enough for you.

## About Ai Model
You can customize your chat ai model by setting the AI Model in the config panel. You can choose text-davinci-003 which is the latest model, powerful and smarter, but note that it takes a bit time to generate response for your question. 

If you want faster response speed, and also get good quality response, text-curie-001 is the one you may like.

Below models are available, and the model details are shown as below.
